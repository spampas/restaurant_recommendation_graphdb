This project has been developed as a workgroup during the classes of Large-Scale and Multi-Structured Databases course in the Computer Engineering degree course of the University of Pisa. The aim of this project is the development of a simple Java application connecting to a graph database, starting from requirements and arriving to implementation.

To have more details, see the [design](design.pdf) and the [documentation](documentation.pdf)



To run the application you need to create a graph database on Neo4J using the dumb in the [db](./db) folder. After starting the database, from the command line, execute the [binary codes](./bin) with the following commands:
