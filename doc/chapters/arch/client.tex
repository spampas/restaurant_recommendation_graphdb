\section{Client}\label{sec:client}

The client is the program run by the user. It just reads the input from the user
from which builds the requests for the server and send them out. When the server
responds, the client shows the results to the user and waits for new input. A
graphical interface is provided: the user will issue commands by selecting
tables' elements and by filling forms.
